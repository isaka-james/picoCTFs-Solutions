## Additional Informations:
#### Hints
1. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.
2. What happens when you click a bookmarklet?.
3. Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

#### Links:
1. http://titan.picoctf.net:57091/

## Explain what we should do:
1. We need to go to the links that we are given, and then look to the visible webpage if the link is seen?
2. If we cannot find the flag then we should look for the source code for the website
3. If there are any encryptions then we should decrypt them to find the keys

### Step 1:

### Step 2:
By typing view-source on the link we provided, we are able to see source codes:

Upon looking on the source codes, we got to see what we aftering,,

By using chatgpt I was able to find plain js code that we can run on the browser tools to find the decrypted flag,

By running the codes we got we can easly get the flag!

Now you got the flag!!,

## DISCLAIMER
I didn't put the flag public so I don't violate the picoCTF policy.
