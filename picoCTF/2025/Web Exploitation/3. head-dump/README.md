## **Steps Taken**

### Step 1: Initial Exploration

- I started by manually exploring the application, visiting all the links (hrefs) found within the interface. However, I did not find any useful endpoints during this process.
  
### Step 2: Directory Bruteforce with Gobuster

- Since manual exploration didn‚Äôt yield useful results, I turned to directory enumeration using `gobuster`. I initially ran the tool with default wordlists, but they didn‚Äôt return useful endpoints.
  
- I then found a more relevant wordlist: [API Endpoints List](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/api/api-endpoints-res.txt). After downloading this list, I used it in my gobuster scan to discover more endpoints.

  The command I ran:
  ```bash
  gobuster dir -u http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:62811 -w api-endpoints-res.txt -t 50 -o results.txt
  ```

  The output was insightful, and I found an endpoint `/api-docs`. This likely pointed to the Swagger UI documentation for the API, which gave me a better understanding of the app‚Äôs structure.

  **Note**: From the Swagger UI, I assumed the application was built using a Python framework.

### Step 3: Identifying Critical Endpoints

- Among the endpoints I discovered, I found `/get-heapdump`. This endpoint triggered the download of the app's memory allocation status, which could provide valuable information about the app‚Äôs internal structure and potential vulnerabilities.

### To Be Continued...

I will further investigate the heapdump and proceed with the next steps to solve the challenge.

## Conclusion

This documentation highlights the methods used to explore the SSTI1 challenge. The steps detailed here will help guide future attempts and approaches in solving similar challenges in backend security assessments. Stay tuned for the next steps after analyzing the heapdump data!
